In the realm of the possible, we seek input from craftspeople who strive to
own the means of their intellectual labor, using tools and platforms free--to
the utmost extent possible--from extractive and exploitative practices. 

*Workshops* are domain-specific curricula that advance a beginning
practitioner to the intermediate and the expert levels of craft. Some examples
of our workshops include Amateur Librarian, Academic Author, Media
Archaeologist, and Textual Scholar. These are curated by moderators,
responsible for coverage and quality of material.

*Tutorials* represent modular, domain-independent lesson plans necessary for
contemporary knowledge work. Foundational tutorial are often shared among
multiple workshops. All material in this category is reviewed by at least two
of our editors and indicated as such (we don't have this implemented yet).

*Lessons* are integral, atomic components that make up our tutorials.
Individual lessons do not necessarily make sense on their own: they are
usually collated into larger groupings.

We welcome and credit all pull requests from the broader community: if you fix
an error, want to translate or contribute to any existing material please do
not hesitate to get in touch. Guidelines for contributors can be found here.

The Forge was founded with support from several sister communities including
Global Emergent Media Lab at Concordia University, Columbia University's
Studio at Butler Library, Price DH Lab at University of Pennsylvania, and
Memory of the World Collective, Centre for Postdigital Cultures at Coventry
University.
