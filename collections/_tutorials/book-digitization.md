This tutorial breaks down the process of digitization into description of
steps that constitute a workflow leading from a printed book to an e-book,
each of which can be in a concrete situation addressed in various
manners---depending on the scanning equipment, software, technical support and
user skill level that are available to your book scanning project. This
tutorial will try to indicate the design choices you have in the process of
planning your workflow and should help you make decisions on what design is
best suited for you situation. It will also provide a manual for the [Memory

own-built two-camera scanner and all Free Software process.
