In this tutorial we will learn XYZ.

## Why command line?

- core skill
- simple
- powerful
- lasting
- universal
- hackable
- fun

Integrate the command line into your daily routine to manipulate files and
folders, to launch applications, and for simple system-related scripting as an
advanced replacement for your finder (file explorer) and spotlight.

## Shell

>  Bash/sh/zsh family is brilliant at intense interaction with humans. Aliases,
>  short built-in commands, one liner-oriented nature, keyboard ergonomics,
>  really concise file/process handling - all of this makes it _the
>  shell_.<sup>1</sup>

> The craft of scripting is not hard to master, since scripts can be built in
> bite-sized sections and there is only a fairly small set of shell-specific
> operators and options [1] to learn. The syntax is simple---even austere---
> similar to that of invoking and chaining together utilities at the command
> line, and there are only a few "rules" governing their use. Most short
> scripts work right the first time, and debugging even the longer ones is
> straightforward.<sup>2</sup>

> One person who posted to the net said he had an "epiphany" from a shell
> script (which used four commands and a script that looked like line noise)
> which renamed all his `.pas` files so that they ended with `.p` instead. I
> reserve my religious ecstasy for something more than renaming files. And,
> indeed, that was my memory of Unix tools---you spend all your time learning
> to do complex and peculiar things that are, int he end, not really all that
> impressive.<sup>3</sup>
